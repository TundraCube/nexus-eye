**Industrial-grade syntax highlighting for Angular inline templates on GitHub.**

Nexus-Eye is a Chrome extension designed to bring IDE-level visual clarity to GitHub Pull Requests. It solves the "White Text Problem" by identifying Angular template regions inside TypeScript files and applying a high-contrast, professional theme instantly.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Modern Control Flow**: Full support for Angular v17+ structural blocks (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`, `@defer`, etc.).
- **Signal Aware**: Highlighting for `signal()`, `computed()`, and interpolation `{{ }}`.
- **Surgical Precision**: Isolated strictly to `template: \`` blocks—your TypeScript logic and metadata remain untouched.
- **Interactive Toggle**: Enable/disable highlighting instantly via the extension icon.
